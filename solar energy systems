## My idea is to collect all solar product on sale on alibaba, for that i use the code bellow
## how ever the code only read the first page, or there is 270 pages
## the ".title a" nodes was found by using selector gadget
## how can i get the name of all products in those 270 pages?

## Products 
aliurl<-"http://www.alibaba.com/products/F0/solar/CID100705.html"
products<-aliurl %>%
  html() %>%
  html_nodes(".title a")%>%
  html_text()
### checking Price
aliurl<-"http://www.alibaba.com/products/F0/solar/CID100705.html"
price<-aliurl %>%
  html() %>%
  html_nodes(".title+ .attr")%>%
  html_text()
## company producer
aliurl<-"http://www.alibaba.com/products/F0/solar/CID100705.html"
